If you see this, in the form i had to send the data to a backend 

so he tests if it's a true credit card or not but i don't have a backend partner so 

i simulated the xmlHttpRequest from './src/Components/Form/fakeBackend.json'

and you can play with those booleans in the fakeBackend.json to test the strength of the form
